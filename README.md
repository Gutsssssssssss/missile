## Project Overview
### üöÄ **Ballistic Missile Simulation**
- Simplified ballistic missile model: considers only **parabolic motion and gravity**, ignoring air resistance, Coriolis effect, and weather.
- The missile flies toward the **target city**, and when it collides with the city, an **explosion event** is triggered.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Anti-Ballistic Missile Simulation**
- **Guidance systems implemented**:
  - **Pure Pursuit** ‚Üí directly follows the target‚Äôs current position.  
    This method is highly inefficient against **ballistic missiles**, since they travel at extremely high speeds.  
    For an interceptor to succeed with Pure Pursuit, it would need to be **faster than the ballistic missile itself**, which is practically impossible.
  - **Proportional Navigation** ‚Üí improves on this by predicting the missile‚Äôs future trajectory and guiding the interceptor accordingly, resulting in **much higher interception success rates**.
- On successful interception, an **explosion animation** occurs at the collision point.

## Future Plans
- **Radar Implementation**: Currently, the anti-ballistic missile tracks the ballistic missile based only on its coordinates.  
  Future development will focus on simulating radar functionality, including:
    - **Wave propagation** for detecting targets.
    - **Doppler effect** for measuring relative velocity.
    - **Launch point prediction** and trajectory estimation based on radar signals.
