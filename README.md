## Project Overview
### üöÄ **Ballistic Missile Simulation**
- Simplified ballistic missile model: considers only **parabolic motion and gravity**, ignoring air resistance, Coriolis effect, and weather.
- The missile flies toward the **target city**, and when it collides with the city, an **explosion event** is triggered.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Anti-Ballistic Missile Simulation**
- **Guidance systems implemented**:
    - **Pure Pursuit** ‚Üí directly tracks the current position of the ballistic missile.
    - **Proportional Navigation** ‚Üí predicts the missile‚Äôs trajectory and intercepts accordingly.
- On successful interception, an **explosion event** occurs at the collision point.

## Future Plans
- **Radar Implementation**: Currently, the anti-ballistic missile tracks the ballistic missile based only on its coordinates.  
  Future development will focus on simulating radar functionality, including:
    - **Wave propagation** for detecting targets.
    - **Doppler effect** for measuring relative velocity.
    - **Launch point prediction** and trajectory estimation based on radar signals.
